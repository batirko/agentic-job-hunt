---

## doctor

Validates that all prerequisites are in place: Node.js >= 18, dependencies installed, Playwright chromium, required files (`cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `portals.yml`), fonts directory, and auto-creates `data/`, `output/`, `reports/` if missing.

```bash
npm run doctor
```

**Exit codes:** `0` all checks passed, `1` one or more checks failed (fix messages printed).

---

## verify

Health check for pipeline data integrity. Validates **both tracker files** — `data/applications.md` and `data/applications-archive.md` — against seven rules: canonical statuses (per `templates/states.yml`), no duplicate company+role pairs, all report links point to existing files, scores match `X.XX/5` / `N/A` / `DUP`, rows have proper pipe-delimited format, no pending TSVs in `batch/tracker-additions/`, and no markdown bold in scores.

```bash
npm run verify
```

**Exit codes:** `0` pipeline clean (zero errors), `1` errors found. Warnings (e.g. possible duplicates) do not cause a non-zero exit.

---

## normalize

Maps non-canonical statuses to their canonical equivalents and strips markdown bold and dates from the status column. Aliases like `Enviada` become `Aplicado`, `CERRADA` becomes `Descartado`, etc. DUPLICADO info is moved to the notes column.

```bash
npm run normalize             # apply changes
npm run normalize -- --dry-run  # preview without writing
```

Runs over both tracker files, one at a time. Creates a `.bak` backup of each before writing.

**Exit codes:** `0` always (changes or no changes).

---

## dedup

Removes duplicate entries from **both tracker files**, one file at a time, by grouping on normalized company name + fuzzy role match. A duplicate that spans the two files is a merge bug rather than a dedup one — `merge-tracker.mjs` checks the archive before opening a live row, and `verify-pipeline.mjs` reports any that slipped through. Keeps the entry with the highest score. If a removed entry had a more advanced pipeline status, that status is promoted to the keeper.

```bash
npm run dedup             # apply changes
npm run dedup -- --dry-run  # preview without writing
```

Creates a `.bak` backup before writing.

**Exit codes:** `0` always.

---

## merge

Merges batch tracker additions (`batch/tracker-additions/*.tsv`) into `data/applications.md`. Handles 9-column TSV, 8-column TSV, and pipe-delimited markdown formats. Detects duplicates by report number, entry number, and company+role fuzzy match. Higher-scored re-evaluations update existing entries in place.

Reads `data/applications-archive.md` too, but never writes it. An addition matching an archived row is reported and skipped rather than opened as a second live row — reviving a closed role is a judgment call, so it stays a manual move.

```bash
npm run merge                 # apply merge
npm run merge -- --dry-run    # preview without writing
npm run merge -- --verify     # merge then run verify-pipeline
```

Processed TSVs are moved to `batch/tracker-additions/merged/`.

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` verification errors (with `--verify`).

---

## pdf

Renders an HTML file to a print-quality, ATS-parseable PDF via headless Chromium. Resolves font paths from `fonts/`, normalizes Unicode for ATS compatibility (em-dashes, smart quotes, zero-width characters), and reports page count and file size.

```bash
npm run pdf -- input.html output.pdf
npm run pdf -- input.html output.pdf --format=letter   # US letter
npm run pdf -- input.html output.pdf --format=a4        # A4 (default)
```

**Exit codes:** `0` PDF generated, `1` missing arguments or generation failure.

---

## sync-check

Validates that the agentic-job-hunt setup is internally consistent: `cv.md` exists and is not too short, `config/profile.yml` exists with required fields, no hardcoded metrics in `modes/_shared.md` or `batch/batch-prompt.md`, and `article-digest.md` freshness (warns if older than 30 days).

```bash
npm run sync-check
```

**Exit codes:** `0` no errors (warnings allowed), `1` errors found.

---

## update:check

Checks whether a newer version of agentic-job-hunt is available upstream. Outputs JSON to stdout:

```bash
```

Possible JSON responses:

| `status` | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `up-to-date` | Local version matches remote |
| `update-available` | Newer version exists (includes `local`, `remote`, `changelog`) |
| `dismissed` | User dismissed the update prompt |
| `offline` | Could not reach GitHub |

**Exit codes:** `0` always.

---

## update

Applies the upstream update. Creates a backup branch (`backup-pre-update-{version}`), fetches from the canonical repo, checks out only system-layer files, runs `npm install`, and commits. User-layer files (`cv.md`, `config/profile.yml`, `data/`, etc.) are never touched.

```bash
npm run update
```

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` lock conflict or safety violation.

---

## rollback

Restores system-layer files from the most recent backup branch created during an update.

```bash
```

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `1` no backup branch found or git error.

---

## liveness

Tests whether job posting URLs are still live using headless Chromium. Detects expired patterns (e.g. "job no longer available"), HTTP 404/410, ATS redirect patterns, and apply-button presence. Supports multi-language expired patterns (English, German, French).

```bash
npm run liveness -- https://example.com/job/123
npm run liveness -- https://a.com/job/1 https://b.com/job/2
npm run liveness -- --file urls.txt
```

Each URL gets a verdict: `active`, `expired`, or `uncertain` with a reason.

**Exit codes:** `0` all URLs active, `1` any expired or uncertain.

---

## scan

Zero-token portal scanner. Hits ATS APIs (Greenhouse, Ashby, Lever) and career pages directly — no LLM tokens consumed. Reads `portals.yml` for target companies and search queries, outputs matching listings to stdout and optionally appends to `data/pipeline.md`.

```bash
npm run scan
```

**Exit codes:** `0` scan completed, `1` configuration error or no portals.yml found.

---

## archive-tracker

Moves closed rows out of the live tracker and into `data/applications-archive.md`. Closed means `⏭️` skip, `❌` rejected, `🚫` discarded, `👻` ignored — every status that can no longer change.

```bash
node archive-tracker.mjs           # dry run: what would move
node archive-tracker.mjs --apply   # write both files and re-sort them
```

Rows move verbatim. Nothing is rewritten, rescored, or dropped, and the archive keeps the identical 12-column schema.

This is a split for reading, not a deletion. The archive holds the rejections and the silences, which is the entire input to `analyze-scoring.mjs` and most of `analyze-patterns.mjs`. Every script that analyses the record reads both files via `parseTrackerAll()` in `tracker-core.mjs`; every script that dedups against it checks both.

Re-opening an archived row has no script on purpose: move the line back to `data/applications.md` by hand and set its status.

**Exit codes:** `0` always (moved, or nothing to move).
